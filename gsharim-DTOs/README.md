# Data Models NPM Package ðŸŒ‰

DTOs package for gsharim system, backend & frontend!

## Installation

Run the following command:

```bash
npm install @eco8200/data-models
```

## Development

For each update of the codebase, you should open a new branch containing one of the following prefixes:

```
- major-*
- minor-*
- patch-*
```

This is critical for our CI/CD automations.
Choose the prefix that best fits your changes:

-   major - for big updates (like new DTOs for a new feature, API breaks, large bug fixes)
-   minor - for small updates (for example, new optional fields in a specific DTO)
-   patch - for bugfixes (fixing a DTO that doesn't fit the current scheme/usage, typos in field names and so on)

All the branches should be checked out from master **only**!
