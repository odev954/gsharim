# Contributing to Gsharim
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. Setup the project by running `npm install`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the [documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wpd0fAI1HQdjPQvCm59KzCbNCau6nriL).
5. Ensure the test suite passes, run `npm run ci-test`.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue that pull request!

in the development process please make sure you are guided by the best practices and follow the [conventions file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1suyPaWafLtIO1Yo8tq-U2_iHMWi_fJ074jMMjGcQJEU/edit).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
We use GitHub issues to track bugs.
to report a bug [open a new issue](https://github.com/eco8200/gsharim-client/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=), there is an included report template in the description.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and background
- Steps to reproduce (Be specific!)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We use Eslint as a standard.

* Run `npm run lint` to lint your code
* You can try running `npm run lint-fx` for style unification


## Communication is important!
Please reach out to the team members if something is not clear or if you discovered a critical bug or vulnerability.
